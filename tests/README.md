# Retry scene reload regression

Install this checkout at `<Godot project>/mods-unpacked/six666-BrotatoOnline`, including `tests`, then run:

```powershell
./tests/Test-RetryReload.ps1 -ProjectPath E:/github/BrotatoMod/RecoveredProject
```

Requires the recovered Brotato project and GodotSteam 3.6 (override `-Godot` as needed). The runner isolates user data, disables saving, verifies the deployed dispatcher hash, and writes timestamped logs and screenshots beside the project under `logs/retry-reload-regression`.

This is a controlled runtime regression using actual battle scenes and the unmodified production scene dispatcher. It constructs a failed-wave UI state, supplies the retry message at the menu-sync boundary, and checks scene instance IDs. A test subclass isolates network roster lookup and RunData deserialization. It does not claim to exercise natural combat deaths, Steam/LAN delivery, or the full host/client ready handshake.

Coverage: a new retry within the previous 12-second flight window; repeated requests before/after scene creation; ordinary scene refresh; successive generations with identical path/config; late duplicate and stale generations after natural window expiry; session reset allowing start IDs to restart. Old duplicate/stale retries must not reapply RunData.
